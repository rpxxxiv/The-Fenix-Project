        I happened upon The Fenix Project by chance when I asked my roommate
        where we should go when I knew we had a different destination in mind.
        Without hesitation, she replied, The Belmont Inn; so we went. When we
        arrived we heard a sound that resonated through my spirit. This sound
        was coming from a band known as The Fenix Project. A five piece blues
        band, with an energy that I seldom see from other bands, I was instantly
        attracted to them. I knew there was something there.
        <br /><br />
        I approached the band with the greatest excitement and told them about
        what ADNW does as a company and within a couple of months we all became 
        family. Since that time we have seen the band members change, making the 
        band unbelievably better, but the energy and the excitement remained. 
        Their sound, including but not limited to, drums, bass, guitar, and Fenix's 
        amazing sax playing fuse together to create an ambiance of pure blues genius. 
        Joined by many talented musicians and well known guests every Wednesday night 
        at The Blue Diamond, the band never disappoints. When you walk through the door, 
        The Fenix Project becomes the sound of blues where your soul is incapable of 
        feeling blue.

        Myself and the entire team of ADNW are pleased and honored to be working with 
        such an inspirational and moving band and we hope that you will join us to 
        experience the feeling and passion that I first felt when I heard the notes 
        sang through Portland.
        <br /><br />
        We hope to see you at the show!
