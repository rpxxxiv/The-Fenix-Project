        FRED GARNER: Bass
    </p>
    <p>
        Fred has been on the Portland music scene since the early 90's involved in
        many genres of music. Fred has complimented many different groups playing 
        jazz, rock, pop, cajun, country, african, and of course blues.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you've seen some of Portland's top entertainers through the years, you've
        seen Fred up there on bass anchoring the rhythm section.

        A partial list would include Paul Delay, Robbie Laws, Kenny Blue Ray, Kinzel 
        and Hyde, Obo Addy, Chata Addy, JR Sims, and Rae Gordon. Fred Gives The Fenix 
        Project an unshakeable rock solid foundation upon which to build.
