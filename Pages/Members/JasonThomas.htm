        JASON THOMAS: Lead Guitar and Vocals
    </p>
    <p>
        Although Jason has a young face, he has been playing in Portland for nearly fifteen 
        years, and is a premier "up and coming" local guitarist. He teaches guitar lessons 
        by day, and plays in numerous rock, blues, and country bands weekly. JT has a special 
        affinity for the blues, and plays with an obvious love. After being a regular at 
        the jam, he has played with The Fenix Project for a couple years now.
