        FENIX: Saxphone and Lead Vocals
    </p>
    <p>
        Hailing from Mississippi, Fenix has taken his gospel roots and smooth 
        jazz saxaphone playing, combining them into something you simply must 
        experience. Fenix has toured and has had the honor of playing with 
        several notable national acts. Moved to Oregon in the early 90's and 
        formed The Fenix Rising Band, a seven piece R&B and funk band, 
        reinventing his sound.
    </p>
    <p>
        The Fenix Project, his latest band, is a five piece featuring Fenix on 
        vocals as well as soprano, alto, and tenor saxaphone, Jason Thomas on 
        lead guitar and vocals, Fred Garner on bass, Jeff Otto on keyboard and 
        vocals, and Jeff Frankel on drums.

        "Fenix's smooth vocals and sax work are the feature that ties the entire 
        tone and effect together."
    </p>
    <p>
        "The combination captures the audience's attention and interest, dancers 
        are quickly out on the dance floor."
