        MILES: Trumpet
    </p>
    <p>
        Miles was born and raised in Eugene, OR where he began his musical career playing piano at age 7.  Two years later he found 
        true inspiration when he picked up his grandmother's trumpet.  Miles grew up performing with a circus band, experiencing 
        first hand the exciting impromptu world of vaudeville.  By the time Miles graduated high school, he had won both the Eugene 
        Celebration and Portland Rose Festival battle of the bands.

        Throughout college Miles played in several bands at a time, with styles ranging from funk rock reggae to soul blues R&B to 
        psychedelic jazz and everything in between.  These were the years that he became serious about the blues and religiously 
        attended every jam he could find.  The blues is not only close to Miles' heart, it is a integral part of his musical education.

        As a newcomer to the Portland scene, Miles has been attending blues jams as often as possible.  The blues community immediately 
        took notice of his fresh exciting sound, (self described as "playing the joy of life.")  After discovering the Fenix Project jam 
        at the Blue Diamond, Miles attended every week.  A few weeks later Fenix approached Miles after the jam and told him, "I can't 
        justify not hiring you to play in the band" and the new guy has been turning heads of everyone in attendance ever since.
